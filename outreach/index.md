> I think fun experiments and good metaphors are worth a thousand words.
 
I have been involved in several outreach projects, or projects for education to scientific culture. Here are some excerpts.

I was previously involved in the _Sc__ience_ _in Schools_  education project, whose aim is to promote scientific culture in schools, by bringing scientific experiments, instruments and researchers to classrooms. Building on my extensive experience, it is my wish to broaden my commitment to education to scientific culture, by participating in the innovative EGU[1](#sdfootnote1sym) _Teacher-Scientist Pairing_ project (**TSP**). Relying on the close collaboration of school teachers and scientists to elaborate lessons, the paired teaching pedagogy is designed to support the teaching of scientific concepts, with students using real data and instruments, and has already been successful in earthquake education[2](#sdfootnote2sym). I will teach about plate tectonics, earthquakes, preventing misconceptions (for instance, that pets can predict earthquakes) and preparing to safety measures; but another of my goal is representation: having a female scientist  in class conveys a strong message to students.

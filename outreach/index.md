I have been involved in several outreach projects, or projects for education to scientific culture. Here are some excerpts.

#### Sismos à l'école

Now part of the [*Science in Schools*](http://www.sciencesalecole.org/plan-sismos-a-lecole-presentation/)  education project, whose aim is to promote scientific culture in schools, by bringing scientific experiments, instruments and researchers to classrooms. I taught classes with fun experiments with pastas and soundmeters to explain earthquakes and seismic risks. I visited middle school students for cycles of 4 to 5 classes. Children loved to play with "earthquake-like" experiments, and having a female scientist in class conveyed a powerful message.

#### My PhD in 180 seconds

I presented uncertainties in our knowledge of earthquakes with a chocolate analogy. It worked so well I still use it!
I gave several outreach presentations related to this event in the years 2017-2019.

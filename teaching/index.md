I am currently not teaching any classes. You can find below some lecture notes or tutorials I wrote in the past.

### LaTeX tutorials
In 2020 and 2021, I gave a series of tutorials on the use of LaTeX, with many hard-learned tips. Here are the resources (in French):  
- Beginning with LaTeX [![PDF]({{ site.url }}/images/pdf.png)](débuter_latex.pdf)
- Writing my PhD with LaTeX [![PDF]({{ site.url }}/images/pdf.png)](écrire_thèse_latex.pdf)

> We rely on inferences of subsurface fault slip to provide important insights after major earthquakes. More generally, we often use these images to explore the physics of the seismic source as well as post-seismic phenomena. We thus need these inferred images to be as accurate as possible, but we also need to be able to describe their limits, as well as the limits of the interpretations we derive from them.

> My research mainly focuses on the impact of an inaccurate description of the Earth s interior on source estimates. I focus on the effect of fault geometry, 3D crustal structure, and topography, and show that accounting for imperfect descriptions systematically increases the reliability of source estimates.

Welcome!

I am the [GPS](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/) Chair’s Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/). 
I completed my PhD in Geophysics at [Géoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur), Université Côte d’Azur, in May 2019.

I am particularly interested in earthquakes and faults behavior. My current research focuses on source estimation problems. I try to improve our understanding of what is inferred by source inversions and what are the uncertainties of inferred parameters.


You can find me in my office in the [Seismological Laboratory](http://seismolab.caltech.edu/) building:  
_Office 262  |  South Mudd building_  
_Caltech Seismo Lab | GPS Division_  
_1200 E. California Blvd., 252-21 | Pasadena, CA 91125, USA_

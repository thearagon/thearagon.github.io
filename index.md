Welcome!

I am *Chargée de recherche [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en)* at the *Institut des Sciences de la Terre* ([ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en)) in Grenoble. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), and completed my PhD at [Géoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur).

My research aims at better understanding the **deformation of the shallow parts of the Earth** on multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the displacement induced a few seconds to days **before, during and after an earthquake** to the long-term interaction of fault networks. 

You can find me in my office in the [ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en) building:  
_Office 316_  
_OSUG-C (Maison des Géosciences)_  
_1381, rue de la Piscine | 38610 Gières | France_

You can also contact me by email:  
*thea.ragon (at) univ-grenoble-alpes.fr*

I am always looking for students and postdocs. If you are interested in earthquakes, want to work with me or a member of the team, and visit Grenoble, contact me!

### Latest News

- *April 2025*: I will not be at EGU. Tobias Köhne will present some work on The Impact of 3D Elastic Structure on Estimates of Megathrust Frictional Properties, and Erwan Pathier on Quantifying interseismic deformation along the Mexican subduction zone.

- *Jan 2025*: [The preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/8436/) about our framework to solve for source time functions while updating empirical Green's functions is out. [The code is here](https://github.com/thearagon/DeepGEM_EGF). Any comment welcome!

- *Oct 2024*: I am glad to be part of the scientific committee and to attend the [2024 Cargèse School on Earthquakes](https://earthquakes4.sciencesconf.org/) in Corsica, France. Stay tuned for next occurences! 

- *Sept 2024*: Angela presented a poster on [our recent work at SCEC](https://central.scec.org/publication/13992)

Welcome!

In 2024, I will start a new position as *Chargée de recherche [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en)* at the *Institut des Sciences de la Terre* ([ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en)) in Grenoble. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), and completed my PhD at [Géoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur).

My research aims at better understanding the **deformation of the shallow parts of the Earth** on multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the displacement induced a few seconds to days **before, during and after an earthquake** to the long-term interaction of fault networks. 

In a few months, you will find me in my office in the [ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en) building:  
_Office 202_  
_OSUG-C (Maison des Géosciences)_  
_1381, rue de la Piscine | 38610 Gières | France_

But right now, rather try to reach me via:

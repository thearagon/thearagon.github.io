Welcome!

I am *ChargÃ©e de recherche [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/en)* (equivalent to associate prof.) at the *Institut des Sciences de la Terre* ([ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en)) in Grenoble. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/), and completed my PhD at [GÃ©oazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur).

My research aims at better understanding the **deformation of the shallow parts of the Earth** on multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the displacement induced a few seconds to days **before, during and after an earthquake** to the long-term interaction of fault networks. 

You can find me in my office in the [ISTerre](https://www.isterre.fr/?lang=en) building:  
_Office 316_  
_OSUG-C (Maison des GÃ©osciences)_  
_1381, rue de la Piscine | 38610 GiÃ¨res | France_

You can also contact me by email:  
*thea.ragon (at) univ-grenoble-alpes.fr*

I am always looking for students and postdocs. If you are interested in earthquakes, want to work with me or a [member of the team](https://www.isterre.fr/french/recherche/equipes-de-recherche/cycle-sismique-et-deformations-transitoires/), and visit Grenoble, contact me!

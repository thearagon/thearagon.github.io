Welcome!

I am the [GPS](https://www.gps.caltech.edu/) Chair’s Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the [California Institute of Technology](https://www.caltech.edu/). 
I completed my PhD in Geophysics at [Géoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu/fr/acc-geoazur), Université Côte d’Azur, in May 2019.

My research aims at better understanding the **deformation of the shallow parts of the Earth** on multiple temporal and spatial scales, from the displacement induced a few seconds to days **before, during and after an earthquake** to the long-term interaction of fault networks. I am particularly interested in modeling or simulating earthquakes and faults behavior.  
These last few years, I focused on source estimation problems, using probabilistic approaches to decipher the robust characteristics, or the uncertainties, of our models. I also use stochastic methods to study recent large earthquakes. Finally, I am also interested in how faults interact with each other and how their geometry impacts the deformation.

- *November 2020*: A. Nutz's work on the **Plio-Pleistocene sedimentation in West Turkana (Kenya, EARS): Paleolake fluctuations, paleolandscapes and controlling factors** is now out in [Earth Science Reviews](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2020.103415). 

- *October 2020*: Alexis Nutz will present **Plio-pleistocene paleoenvironments in West Turkana (East African Rift System, Kenya)** at the [GSA Meeting - 10/29 at 7:15pm](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2020AM/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/351278). 

- *September 2020*: Our work on the **stochastic view of the 2020 Elazığ Mw 6.8 earthquake** (Turkey) is available as a [Preprint](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10504361.1)

- *August 2020*: Our work on **Bayesian estimate of interseismic slip deficit of the East and North Anatolian faults** (Turkey) is now published in [GRL](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL087775)

- *July 2020*: Our work on the **impact of topography on slip estimates** is now published in *Tectonophysics*. We notably show that topography can largely affect slip models even when using geodetic data only, and that zeroth-order corrections are not sufficient to account for induced biases.

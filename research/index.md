My research interests include:  
- Complexity of the seismic source
- Modeling of the seismic source and slip
- Fault slip modeling (including post-seismic and aseismic processes)
- Geometry of the causative fault
- Inverse problems
- Fault interactions
- Tectono-sedimentary processes of continental rift basins

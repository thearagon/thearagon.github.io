<h1> Research </h1>

#### Open Science
I make my research as open as possible, by openly archiving my publications, and sharing research data, scripts and numerical results. I give priority to journals that support Open Science when submitting research articles or accepting reviewer positions. I am willing to improve my open-source programming techniques. I am also the co-chair of the Standars and Copy-Editing team and handling editor for the diamond Open Access journal [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/).

### Research Interests
<left>
My research interests include:  
</left>
<ul style="text-align:left; list-style-position:inside;">
  <li>Complexity of the seismic source </li>
  <li>Modeling of the seismic source and slip (including post-seismic and aseismic processes)  </li>
  <li>Geometry of the causative fault</li>
  <li> Uncertainty assessment and inverse problems   </li>
  <li> Kinematics of fault networks, fault interactions </li>
  <li> Tectono-sedimentary processes of continental rift basins  </li>
</ul>

#### Open Science
I make my research as open as possible, by openly archiving my publications, and sharing research data, scripts and numerical results. I give priority to journals that support Open Science when submitting research articles or accepting reviewer positions. I am willing to improve my open-source programming techniques. I am also the co-chair of the *Standards and Copy-Editing team* and handling editor for the diamond Open Access journal [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/).

### Research Interests
Can we determine what controls the nucleation, propagation and arrest of seismic ruptures? Are the properties of large and small earthquakes generic? These questions remain open. Geodetic and seismological data suggest that fast and slow slips may be influenced by lithospheric heterogeneities and off-fault mechanisms. The role of these off-fault complexities and deformations is poorly studied from surface measurements, because they are easily reproduced with over-simplistic assumptions, such as a planar fault in an elastic homogeneous medium.

My objective is to integrate these heterogeneities into slip and source imaging procedures to highlight fundamental mechanisms, proxys or recurring patterns that, until now, could not be mapped and therefore remained unknown. Depict the interactions between deformations across multiple spatio-temporal scales, and compare them with simple physical models, will allow us to understand whether, and if yes how, fault zone heterogeneities and mechanisms could control major seismic ruptures.
